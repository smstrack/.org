								<h2>Welcome:</h2>
								<p>
									Welcome to the SM South Raider Track &amp; Field Team.&nbsp; By choosing to be part of this team, you have made your part of a great institution at SM South High School.&nbsp; This team has a deep tradition of excellence in the state of Kansas.&nbsp;
									This tradition includes many state team championships, state team placings, individual state champions, and 5 Kansas All-time best performers.&nbsp; SM South has also had countless individual and relay state medalists.</p>
								<p>
									Not every athlete that has worn a Raider track &amp; field uniform has gone on to become a top notch performer, but they have all been an integral part of the team.&nbsp; No one student-athlete is any less important than another.&nbsp; This program is
									a family and we all share in the success and heartbreaks together as a team.&nbsp;
								</p>
								<p>
									You will get as much out of this experience as you let yourself.&nbsp; Try new events, work hard everyday, and be a team player.&nbsp; If you do those things, success will come in many different ways.&nbsp; This team has no cuts and no bench.&nbsp; Everyone
									gets to take part and can be successful in their own way.&nbsp; ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s not about wins and losses, but the improvements that you personally make.&nbsp; Thank you for choosing to be a part of this program and good luck to you.&nbsp;
								</p>

								<p>&nbsp;</p>
