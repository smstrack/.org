						<h2>Welcome:</h2>
						<p>
							Welcome to the SM South Raider Track &amp; Field Team.&nbsp; By choosing to be part of this team, you have made
							your part of a great institution at SM South High School.&nbsp; This team has a deep tradition of excellence in
							the state of Kansas.&nbsp;
							This tradition includes many state team championships, state team placings, individual state champions, and 5
							Kansas All-time best performers.&nbsp; SM South has also had countless individual and relay state medalists.</p>
						<p>
							Not every athlete that has worn a Raider track &amp; field uniform has gone on to become a top notch performer,
							but they have all been an integral part of the team.&nbsp; No one student-athlete is any less important than
							another.&nbsp; This program is
							a family and we all share in the success and heartbreaks together as a team.&nbsp;
						</p>
						<p>
							You will get as much out of this experience as you let yourself.&nbsp; Try new events, work hard everyday, and
							be a team player.&nbsp; If you do those things, success will come in many different ways.&nbsp; This team has no
							cuts and no bench.&nbsp; Everyone
							gets to take part and can be successful in their own way. It's not about wins and losses, but the improvements
							that you personally make.&nbsp; Thank you for choosing to be a part of this program and good luck to you.&nbsp;
						</p>
