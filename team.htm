					Welcome to the SM South Raider Track &amp; Field Team.&nbsp; By choosing to be part of this team, you have
					made
					yourself part of a great institution at SM South High School.&nbsp; This team has a deep tradition of excellence
					in
					the state of Kansas.&nbsp;
					This tradition includes many state team championships, state team placings, individual state champions, and
					5
					Kansas All-time best performers.&nbsp; SM South has also had countless individual and relay state medalists.
				</p>
				<p>
					Not every athlete that has worn a Raider track &amp; field uniform has gone on to become a top notch
					performer,
					but they have all been an integral part of the team.&nbsp; No one student-athlete is any less important than
					another.&nbsp; This program is
					a family and we all share in the success and heartbreaks together as a team.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					You will get as much out of this experience as you let yourself.&nbsp; Try new events, work hard everyday,
					and
					be a team player.&nbsp; If you do those things, success will come in many different ways.&nbsp; This team
					has no
					cuts and no bench.&nbsp; Everyone
					gets to take part and can be successful in their own way. It's not about wins and losses, but the
					improvements
					that you personally make.&nbsp; Thank you for choosing to be a part of this program and good luck to
					you.&nbsp;
				</p>
